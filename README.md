## Grow together, connect forever!

**greenthumb** is a web application that allows people in an area to find community gardens and interact with other like-minded people. The application is built with the [t3-stack](https://create.t3.gg), which includes the following important libraries:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org): for routing and designing the frontend, using [React](https://www.react.dev) components.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): for styling the frontend.
- [TRPC](https://trpc.io/): to communicate with the backend.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): a Typescript ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to connect the database schema with the backend and frontend.
- [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/): an authentication layer for NextJS applications.

The database uses PostgreSQL and hosted by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
